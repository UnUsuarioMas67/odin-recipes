    <p>
      This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need.
      Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest,
      most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.
    </p>
    <h2>What Makes This Fried Chicken So Crispy?</h2>
    <p>There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like
        consistency is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness
        on the inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the
        frying process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat
        â€” after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll
        turn up the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy
        texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps
        with browning the chicken.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Ingredients (ul) -->
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Steps (ol) -->
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken
      you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season
      the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika
      helps to brown the chicken).
    </li>
    <li>
      Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put
      them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat
      well.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover
      with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR
      IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
    </li>
    <li>
      Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.
    </li>
    <li>
      When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not
      crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few
      shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.
    </li>
  </ol>
